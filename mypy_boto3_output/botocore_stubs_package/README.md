## How to install

<a id="basic"></a>

### Basic

Install `botocore-stubs` to add type annotations for `botocore` package.
Install `boto3-stubs` to add type annotations for `boto3` package.

```bash
# install type annotations only for botocore
python -m pip install botocore-stubs

# install type annotations only for boto3 and botocore
python -m pip install botocore-stubs boto3-stubs

# install `boto3` type annotations
# for ec2, s3, rds, lambda, sqs, dynamo and cloudformation
# Consumes ~7 MB of space
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[essential]'

# or install annotations for services you use
python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[acm,apigateway]'
```

<a id="how-to-uninstall"></a>

## How to uninstall

```bash
# uninstall boto3-stubs
python -m pip uninstall -y boto3-stubs botocore-stubs

# uninstall submodules
python -m pip freeze | grep mypy-boto3 | xargs python -m pip uninstall -y
```

<a id="usage"></a>

## Usage

<a id="vscode"></a>

### VSCode

- Install
  [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- Install
  [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- Set `Pylance` as your Python Language Server
- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment:
  `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`

Both type checking and auto-complete should work for installed `boto3`
services. No explicit type annotations required, write your `boto3` code as
usual.

<a id="pycharm"></a>

### PyCharm

- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment:
  `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Install `mypy_boto3_builder`: `pip install mypy_boto3_builder`
- Generate stubs in `<project_root>/typings` directory for services you use

```bash
python -m mypy_boto3_builder --installed --skip-services typings -d -s s3 ec2
```

- Add `<project_root>/typings` folder to your
  [Interpreter Paths](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/stubs.html#reuse-stubs)

Since stubs are stored in your project root, you do not need to re-generate
them after update.

<a id="emacs"></a>

### Emacs

- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment:
  `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Install [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package),
  [lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/),
  [company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode) and
  [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) packages
- Install [lsp-pyright](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-pyright) package

```elisp
(use-package lsp-pyright
  :ensure t
  :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
                          (require 'lsp-pyright)
                          (lsp)))  ; or lsp-deferred
  :init (when (executable-find "python3")
          (setq lsp-pyright-python-executable-cmd "python3"))
  )
```

- Make sure emacs uses the environment where you have installed `boto3-stubs`

<a id="sublime-text"></a>

### Sublime Text

- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment:
  `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Install [LSP-pyright](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-pyright) package
- Make sure emacs uses the environment where you have installed `boto3-stubs`

<a id="other-ides"></a>

### Other IDEs

Not tested, but as long as your IDE supports `mypy` or `pyright`, everything
should work.

<a id="mypy"></a>

### mypy

- Install `mypy`: `python -m pip install mypy`
- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment:
  `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Run `mypy` as usual

Type checking should work for installed `boto3` services. No explicit type
annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

<a id="pyright"></a>

### pyright

- Install `pyright`: `yarn global add pyright`
- Install `boto-stubs` with services you use in your environment:
  `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`
- Optionally, you can install `boto3-stubs` to `typings` folder.

Type checking should work for installed `boto3` services. No explicit type
annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

<a id="how-it-works"></a>

## How it works

Fully automated
[mypy-boto3-builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3_builder) carefully
generates type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3`
updates. It delivers a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- All available `boto3` services are covered.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type
  annotations extracted from the documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types
  are incorrect).
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Link to documentation is provided for every method.
- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and
  [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for readability.
